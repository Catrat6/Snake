Rules/How to play:

The speed is in snake.py, change move_distance up or down to adjust speed.

1. Green Circles, Food 1 point and one Growth
2. Super Food (Red Square), 3 points and 3 growth
3. Bomb (Giant red squares), take away all your gained length and -3 points
4. Going under 0 kills you, because of how the squares randomely generate you can die instantly, I do plan to fix
this, sorry about that.
5. Hitting wall kills you and ends game.
6. hitting your own body or tail will kill you.
7. The goal is to just keep eating and growing and get the score as high as you can, high score will automatically update
    when it is achieved. **

Next Updates Coming Soon
    - Levels or different challenges based on score.
    - Pause, game will start paused.

Probably not even close to exciting for you as it is for me.
This was my first game in python using actual Graphics.

Started as a Capstone Project

This game started out very basic as just simple capstone project from one of my courses.
I decided to expand on it though instead of just doing the bear minimum
The bear minimum was just black and white, 1 random food piece, ya know the OG first snake.

My Additions

1. I added colors, I also added some more skins for the snake and plan on making cooler ones
    There are methods in there that can make it rainbow. I plan on trying to come up with some cooler ones.

2. Made it so the high score is permanently saved.

3. Added a second food type. The superfood makes you grow 3 times longer and gets you 3 points.

4. Made it way more interesting by adding bombs that show up at random and blow off the majority of your tail.
    These bombs also take away 3 points.

I made *plenty* of other changes as well like including a snake animation in the terminal as the game runs.

Updates

Even though no one will ever play this I will keep updating it and working on it just out of tradition and being my first
Graphical Python Game. Next I plan to add levels and a way to pause, the game should also start paused probs
